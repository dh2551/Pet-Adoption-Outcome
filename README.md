With more and more shelters starting to post their available animals online, we believe that by obtaining and analyzing these data, we can make better suggestions for different shelters and humane societies to better organize and advertise their available animals. We can help increase adoption opportunities for those animals, especially if we can identify animals who might take longer than average to get adopted based on their features such as breed, age, etc. Once we identify these harder-to-adopt animals, shelters and humane societies can reallocate their resources to promote them and thus increase their chances of getting adopted faster. This way, recommendations will not only give these harder-to-adopt pets a second chance to find a home but also save shelters time and resources.
